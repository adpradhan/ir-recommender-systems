1. preprocess
	a. transformData
		takes raw data, converts them into utility matrix and returns
	b. makeMatrix
		reads data from csv files, preprocesses them and returns train and test utility matrices
2. collaborative
	a. get_sim_matrix
		returns similarity (correlation coefficients) matrix
	b. collaborative_without_baseline
		takes training data, number of nearest neighbours considered
		returns reconstructed matrix by predicting test ratings
	c. collaborative_with_baseline
		takes training data, number of nearest neighbours considered
		returns reconstructed matrix by predicting test ratings taking baseline estimates into account
	d. startCollaborative
		acts like driver for collaboratory
		prints details of RMSE, SRC, Precision on Top K for this technique
3. svd
	a. svd_decomp
		takes in the data matrix A and decompose it to U, Sigma and Vt using derivation
	b. svd_decomp_90
		takes in the decomposed U, Sigma and Vt and returns the new ones having 90% energy retainment
	c. runSVD
		driver function to make predictions over test data using similarity matrix
		also runs the metrics to get results
	d. runSVD90
		driver function to make predictions over test data using similarity matrix for 90% retainment
		also runs the metrics to get results
	e. startSVD
		runs the necessary functions to execute the program
4. cur
	a. CUR
		takes in the data matrix A and decomposes it to C, U and R and returns the decomposed matrices.
	b. CUR_90
		takes in the data matrix A and decomposes it to C, U and R and then reduces the dimensions by preserving 90% data.
	c. CUR_driver
		this calls the both the above mentioned functions and also evaluates the answer with the different metrics.
5. metrics
	a. analyse
		takes predicted and testing data
		returns RMSE, SRC, Precision on Top K metrics
